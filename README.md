# ðŸ‘¾ KlownWave

![plot](/img/img0.jpg)

AU / VST Plugin synth written in [Csound](https://csound.com/) and [Cabbage](https://cabbageaudio.com/)

"In this long period of pandemic, for about two years now, we have tried to commit our efforts, for something truly stimulating and of which 
we have always been passionate, and this is how, thanks to the collaboration with the BitNet01 collective, we have been able to develop in this
time, our virtual synthesizer, Vst, with our style and sound timbre that we have called KLOWNWAVE.

We are excited to introduce this new project to you, and we hope you will share our visionary initiative.
KlownWave will be distributed to the public 'by donation', will be open source and hackable"
